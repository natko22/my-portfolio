        The Author Behind the Code{" "}
      </h1>
      <p className="text-book-dark leading-relaxed text-lg text-left">
        Welcome to my digital library, where every line of code tells a story.
        My name is Natassa, and I’m a developer with a passion for crafting
        intuitive, meaningful experiences on the web. Like the chapters of a
        novel, my journey into tech has been a story of discovery, challenges,
        and growth.
      </p>
      <p className="text-book-dark leading-relaxed text-lg text-left">
        With a background in Theology, my leap into technology began as an
        unexpected plot twist—a decision that ignited a love for
        problem-solving, creativity, and lifelong learning. Through dedication
        and curiosity, I’ve transformed that leap into a rewarding adventure,
        one project at a time.
      </p>
      <p className="text-book-dark leading-relaxed text-lg text-left">
        As an avid book lover, I see every project as a new chapter to explore
        and every problem as a puzzle waiting to be unraveled. This portfolio is
        my personal anthology, filled with the lessons, skills, and stories I’ve
        gathered along the way. Whether it’s building seamless interfaces,
        weaving together APIs, or collaborating with others, my goal is to
        create solutions that are as elegant as a well-written page.
      </p>
      <p className="text-book-dark leading-relaxed text-lg text-left">
        Thank you for stepping into my world of code and creativity. I hope
        you’ll find inspiration in these pages as I continue to write my story,
        one keystroke at a time. Let’s create something unforgettable together!
