      <p>
        Welcome to my story in code , where every project is a new chapter and
        every line of code weaves a narrative of creativity and problem-solving.
        My name is Natassa, and I’m a developer who finds inspiration in
        storytelling—both in books and in the digital experiences I create.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a background in Theology, my journey into tech was an unexpected
        plot twist—a leap into a world of logic, design, and endless discovery.
        What started as a simple curiosity became a passion for building
        meaningful, intuitive experiences on the web.

        As an avid book lover, I approach development the same way I approach a
        great novel—with curiosity, patience, and a love for the details. Every
        problem is a puzzle to be unraveled, every project a story waiting to be
        told. Whether it's designing seamless interfaces, weaving together APIs,
        or collaborating with others, my goal is to craft solutions that are as
        engaging as a well-written page.

      <p>
        Thank you for stepping into my world of code and creativity. I hope
        you’ll find inspiration in these pages as I continue to write my story,
        one keystroke at a time. Let’s create something unforgettable together!
