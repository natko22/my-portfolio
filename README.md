## 📖 About the Project

Welcome! I’m **Anastasia Tsapanidou Kornilaki**, a web developer with a passion for both **technology and design**.  
This portfolio is my way of telling a story — not just of the work I’ve done, but the path I’ve taken.

My journey didn’t begin in tech — it began in **Theology**, where I learned to think deeply and observe curiously.  
Over time, my fascination with how websites were built led me to discover web development — a space where **problem-solving, creativity, and logic** come together in perfect harmony.

This portfolio is structured like a book: each chapter represents a part of my evolution — from bootcamp projects to internship experience, and on to my current role in the field.  
With every line of code, I continue learning, adapting, and writing new chapters in my story.

> _“Thank you for stepping into my world of code and creativity. I hope you find inspiration in these pages as I continue to write my story, one keystroke at a time.”_
